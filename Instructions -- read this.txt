This is an optional addon package to Vocatus' PDQ Deploy packages on reddit.com/r/sysadmin
This optional package was introduced in v8.0.

This contains offline update packages that will bring the specified product (e.g. Windows 8.1) up to the patch level of the release date.

If you'd like, it's easy to use the WSUS Offline Update tool to build your own offline update packages ( http://download.wsusoffline.net/ ).
Really this "package" is just a wrapper tool I built to deploy the WSUS Offline packages silently through PDQ.

# INSTRUCTIONS #
################
0. You must be running at least version 3.1 release 3 (v3.1.3.0) of PDQ Deploy; perform a database upgrade if required.

1. Edit the batch file 'wsus_offline_update_launcher.bat' and specify the full path to your updates folder (edit the REMOTE_REPOSITORY variable on or near line 59).
   An example is already filled out for you, just update the variable to reflect the location of your server.
   
2. Import the .xml file(s) from the "\job files" directory into PDQ deploy.
   You should see an additional folder in PDQ Deploy called "Microsoft Offline Updates"
   (If there is an older version of the Microsoft Offline Updates folder in PDQ, delete it and re-import the latest .xml file)

3. Copy everything from the "\repository" directory to wherever your repository is.

4. Once the batch file knows where your server is, AND you've imported the latest PDQ job file, you can push the package
   and it should run fine. Keep in mind that the offline update packages are BIG (generally >1 GB each) and it will take
   a while to run. I see about 30 minutes on average per machine, and that's over a Gigabit connection. Just be patient.
   You may want to tweak PDQ's timeout to be more relaxed also, so it doesn't prematurely kill the deployment.
   
See the attached screenshots for examples of what it should look like.
